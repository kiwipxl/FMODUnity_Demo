# FMODUnity_Demo

This was a small demo built for FMOD that demonstrates the capabilities of their (at the time) new Unity integration. A FMOD Studio project was created for music, SFX, and events such as subtitles, and the Unity project built on top of Unity's tank demo with fully functioning game audio.
